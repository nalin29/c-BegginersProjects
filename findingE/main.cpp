 The mathematica constant e is fount by taing the limit as x -> 0 of (1+1/x)^x.
 This can also be modeled by the Taylor Series polynomial for e^x sum from 0 -> n of x^n/n! centered about 0.
 To find e we can simply set x to 1 leaving us with the sum of 0 -> n of 1/n!.
 A taylor series only approximates the value of e so there is a maximum error that we can calcultae by utlizing Lagrange error.
 This is defined as A(x) = M(x)^n+1/(n+1)! where M is the maximum value of the next term of the taylor series when centered around 0. Since x is equal to 1 we are left with A(1) = M/(n+1)! where it simplifies to 1/(n+1)!.
 Now using this we can sequentially go thorugh the series and stop when our error is less than half our decimal places as to prevent rounding up.
